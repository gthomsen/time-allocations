# vim-timealloc plugin

If you prefer using vim instead, this plugin is for you.
You may map the `Timealloc*` commands to bindings that
work for you.

# Installation

We recommend installing plugin via Pathogen, which can be found at
[vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and follow
the next steps:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/gthomsen/time-allocations.git

Then open vim and run Pathogen's `:Helptags` command to
generate tags for plugin documentation.
